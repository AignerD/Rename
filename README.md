# Rename_files
Renames your files in a folder with just a csv file (First column = location of file | Second column = location of the same file (can be in the same location if wanted)

Simply go to the directory/folder in the terminal (If you don't how to do that just type cmd in your windows search then go here in your browser -  and then comeback) in which you have downloaded the application. Once there just type main.py (assuming that the end of your terminal line ends line "Remane_Files>" or "Rename_Files$") 

Please do not hesitate to turn this into a gui or if you have any suggestions that might make this application better.

Anyways, have fun. 

PS: All my app names are all finally readable ;)
